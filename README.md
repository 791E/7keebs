# 7keebs - 791E's keyboards
This is the repository for my (at the time only) custom keyboard.

## Naming
If I ever get to a point where naming is important, this will be the schema I will be following:
```
[h|p][s][<keys>]
```
h - handwired\
p - PCB\
s - split keyboard\
\<keys\> - number of keys

## Keyboards
The keyboards are listed in the order in which I made them (oldest first).
- [h70](./h70/): A handwired 70 key keyboard

## Licensing
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, everything is licensed under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for more information.
