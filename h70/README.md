# h70 - A handwired 70 key keyboard

## About
The h70 is a handwired 70 key ortholinear keyboard using a modified dvorak layout.
It only uses 1u keys, because that makes it a lot easier to build as well as not requiring stabilizers.
The keyboard works on pretty much any computer (or even mobile device), because it relies on the HID protocol.
Additionally to the extremly efficient layout, the keyboard features up to four customizable keys (three if two keys are used as the spacebar), which could control things on the firmware level or send any combination of keys.
