# Hardware for the h70

## About
In this directory you can find all of the hardware and instructions to build your own 7keebs h70
keyboard.


## Compatibility
The keyboard is designed to work with MX style switches.
However, the board could easily be adapted to any other kind of switch,
by uploading [the layout file](./keyboard-layout.json) to <http://builder.swillkb.com/>
and selecting the desired settings.

The svg file you'll find in this directory was created with laser cutting in mind,
so if you don't want to laser cut, change the settings on <http://builder.swillkb.com/>.
> **Note:** Depending on your specific laser cutter you may need to change the kerf settings.

The keycaps are also designed to work on MX style switches. If you wish to user different
switches, you may need to model (or buy) your own keycaps.

Any ESP32 chip should work. Go to [the firmware's readme](../firmware/README.md) for more
information.

## Building
I recommend following along [this video](https://youtu.be/hjml-K-pV4E?si=fhQ6-7PlXeZj9mB0)
(7:24 - 12:19) by Joe Scotto.

## Credits
The [keycaps](./keycap_1u.stl) were designed by [@ShibMcNe](https://www.printables.com/@ShibMcNe)
on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/67474-flat-mx-keycap/files)

I learned much of the process of making your own keyboard from Joe Scotto
on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@joe_scotto) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/).
